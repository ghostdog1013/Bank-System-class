# Expectations

  We regularly interact with banks in our day-to-day lives, but rarely think about the systems
that power them. Banks power global finance, and the online systems that enable this are
incredibly complex.<br/>
  In this project, you will create a simpler version of a banking system.
You’ll design the banking system using Python OOP techniques. In your bank model, you’ll
want to have entities for customers, accounts, employees, and services like loans and
credit cards. Each of these entities will have distinct properties and you’ll need to decide
what the relevant properties are for each entity.
